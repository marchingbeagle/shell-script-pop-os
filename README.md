# shell-script-pop-os

This script was made for my first steps on pop os, so every time i need to make a fresh install, i can easily reinstall a lot of packages that i use.
If you wanna do something similar for your system, just make sure the downloads folder variable is correct for you.

I use nala instead of standard apt because is significantly faster and also cleaner to visualize in the terminal.
